        <h2>Pokellector Set Downloader</h2>
        <p>
            Use this extension to download set lists from Pokellector.com in CSV format 
            for your own unique use in a spreadsheet or anything else.
            </p>
        <p>
            In order for the extension to work you must be on a "Set" page that
            shows the checklist and text. 
            with <em>list_display=list</em> at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example Page that works:
            <a 
                href="https://www.pokellector.com/sets/BS-Base-Set?list_display=list"
                target="_blank"
            >
                https://www.pokellector.com/sets/BS-Base-Set?list_display=list
            </a>
        </p>
        <button type="button" id="download">
            Download Set!
        </button>
        <p>
